  <h2>Guttering & Roofline FAQs</h2>

  <h3>How do I know if my gutters need replacing?</h3>
  <p>Signs include frequent leaks, sagging sections, rust, cracks or water overflowing during rain. We can inspect and recommend the best solution.</p>

  <h3>How often should gutters be cleaned?</h3>
  <p>Gutters should usually be cleaned at least once a year to prevent blockages and water damage.</p>

  <p>Fascias and soffits are boards along the edge of your roof that support the guttering and help protect the roof structure from weather and pests.</p>
